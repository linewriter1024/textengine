**Keep instructions brief and scannable.**

## Good vs Bad

✅ Code examples over explanations  
✅ Bullets over paragraphs  
❌ Long prose  
❌ Repetitive examples  
❌ Multiple concepts mixed  

## Pattern

```markdown
## Topic

**Key point.**

```code
// Example
```

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
```

## Target Length

- Code: ~150 lines
- Mission: ~100 lines
- Run: ~80 lines
- README: ~200 lines

**Remember**: Brevity = efficiency.
