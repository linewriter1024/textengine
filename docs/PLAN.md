The first real game will be a simple adventure ["West Marches"](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/)-style game.

There will be a hub city, populated with people living their lives, politics, markets, etc. This will enable developing the social side of the game. Then, there will be quests, shops, etc. in the city to send the player (and NPCs) out into the wilderness to progressively more dangerous areas to collect items, bounties, rescues, and so forth.

We need:

- Name generation system - to ensure everybody is uniquely, thematically, and concisely named
- Dice system - to support randomness, circumstances, combat, social encounters, etc.
- High level entities - the city, wilderness areas, monster clans, bandit groups, etc.
- Low level entities - monsters, people, shops, buildings
- Combat
- Social systems
  - Trade
  - Conversation
  - Rumors/quests
  - Autonomy (rival adventurers, bandits, etc.)
