Place/entity positions must be persisted, they should not be in-memory only. (makes it easy to query too, just two SQL queries, one for either direction). One table of entity <-> position mapping. Important: the position should be different depending on "scale" of the feature, e.g. with the current world gen its on "continent" scale, but we might need to generate on dungeon scale, or in a space opera on universe scale. Note that this system does NOT govern most entities, just entities that get placed at a specific spot like forests, ruins, etc. Other entities are simply contained by entities that do have a position. The position is just for reference when laying out the world. I think the spatial system should thus have N dimensions plus a "scale" dimension, which would refer to a UniqueType scale ("continent", "universe", "building", "vehicle", etc.) used when laying out the world. This scale must be specified whenever doing spatial operations, and should be attached to spatial entities as a property. Also, let's use UniqueType constants for item property keys, instead of magic strings. Items should be defined as entity classes (not every item its own class, but for example a sword would be in a Weapon class, a stone might be a generic Item, etc.) In this way the ItemSystem should be build to provide access to properties, etc.
