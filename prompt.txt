Now lets update item interactions. Currently the axe handles cutting down a tree and all logic. The tree should handle what happens to itself. The logic for cutting, instead of being in the Axe entity, should be handled more generically by something that handles the CUT tag on CUTTABLE objects. In this way the Axe and Tree entity classes should just handle adding the tags and any custom description, so we can move that logic out of whatever is adding the tags now.
